# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 40/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** - Your code computed the correct probability and returned it
  * **(-1 pts) You aren't computing probability correctly for scores < 17**
* **(-2pts)** - No docstring
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests
* **(-2pts)** - No docstring
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital
  * **(-1 pts) This code should handle non uppercase hospital names**
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** - Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions
* **(-2pts)** - No docstring

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** - Your code looped through all the results and compared them to the provided key
  * **(-1 pts) my_results won't have a status code**
  * **(-1 pts) This basic comparison might work, but you should have been able to use this function to find errors, too.  Maybe loop through and print things out**

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
